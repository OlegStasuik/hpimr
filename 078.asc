// 13701
//It was Saturday, on the 4th of April, in the year 1992.
Субота, четверте квітня, 1992 рік.

// 13702
//Mr. and Mrs. Davis looked rather nervous, as they sat in a certain special
//section of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands - though today the cushioned benches
//did not look upon flying broomsticks, but rather viewed a gigantic square of
//something like parchment; a great white blankness soon to flicker with windows
//into grass and soldiers. For now it showed only the reflected dull gray color
//of the surrounding overcast skies. (Looking rather stormy, though the
//weather-wizards had promised that the rain wouldn’t break before nightfall.)
Містер і місіс Девіс були доволі знервовані, коли сідали на мʼякі лави в певній
спеціальній зоні трибун гоґвортського стадіону для квідичу. Та з цих трибун
сьогодні не побачити польоту мітел -- лише гігантський квадрат чогось на кшталт
пергаменту. Величезна біла поверхня невдовзі перетвориться на вікно з видом на
траву й солдатів. Наразі вона просто забарвлена в похмурий сірий колір неба.
(Що видається доволі неспокійним, хоча погодні чаклуни обіцяли були ясну погоду
до ночі.)

// 13703
//Ordinarily it was the ancient tradition of Hogwarts that mere parents were to
//Stay Out - for much the same reason that impatient children are told to get out
//of the kitchen and not meddle in the cook’s affairs. The only reason for a
//parent-teacher conference was if a teacher felt that a parent wasn’t shaping up
//properly. It took an exceptional circumstance to make the Hogwarts
//administration feel that it had to justify itself to __you.__ On any given
//occasion, generally speaking, the Hogwarts administration was backed up by
//eight hundred years of distinguished history and you were not.
Зазвичай Гоґвортс дотримувався давньої традиції: нехай усього-на-всього батьки
"`не лізуть`" -- з тих самих причин, що й нетерплячим дітям кажуть забиратися з
кухні й не заважати кухареві. Офіційна зустріч між батьками й учителем можлива
з єдиної причини -- якщо вчитель незадоволений прогресом батьків. Щоб
адміністрація Гоґвортсу вважала за потрібне звітувати перед __вами__, потрібні
були надзвичайні обставини. Переважно, хай що коїлося, за плечима адміністрація
Гоґвортсу мала вісімсот років поважної історії, а ви -- ні.

// 13704
//Thus it had been with some trepidation that Mr. and Mrs. Davis had insisted on
//an audience with Deputy Headmistress McGonagall. It was hard to muster a proper
//sense of indignation when you were confronting the same dignified witch who,
//twelve years and four months earlier, had given both of you two weeks’
//detention after catching you in the act of conceiving Tracey.
Тож містер і місіс Девіс з острахом вирішили були наполягати на аудієнції із
заступницею директора Макґонеґел. Доволі важко належним чином висловлювати
обурення, коли спілкуєшся з тією ж самою поважною відьмою, що дванадцять років
та чотири місяці тому призначила була вам двом відпрацювання на два тижні через
те, що заскочила вас під час зачаття Трейсі.

// 13705
//On the other hand, Mr. and Mrs. Davis’s courage had been helped by angrily
//waving about a copy of __The__ __Quibbler__ whose headline showed, in
//bright bold text for all the world to see:
З іншого боку, містера й місіс Девіс морально підтримувало розмахування
примірником "`Базікала`" із жирним яскравим заголовком, що його міг прочитати
весь світ:

// 13706
//PACTS WITH POTTER?
ДОМОВЛЕНОСТІ З ПОТТЕРОМ?

// 13707
//BONES, DAVIS, GRANGER
БОУНЗ, ДЕВІС, ҐРЕЙНДЖЕР

// 13708
//IN LOVE RECTANGLE OF FEAR
У ЛЮБОВНОМУ ПРЯМОКУТНИКУ СТРАХУ

// 13709
//And so Mr. and Mrs. Davis had argued their way into the Faculty Box of the
//Hogwarts Quidditch stands, where they were now ensconced with an excellent view
//of Professor Quirrell’s enchanted screens, so that the two of them could see
//for themselves “Just what the Fiddly-Snocks has been going on in this school,
//if you’ll pardon the expression, Deputy Headmistress McGonagall!”
// @ hedrok: Fiddly-Snocks - не знайшов нічого. snocks близько до "socks", тож
// зробив "шкрапетки"... Щоправда, усім здаватиметься, що це просто помилка, напевно...
// "fiddly" в каноні є один раз, Абабагаламага переклала як "хитромудрий"
// також у 13717
Ось таким чином містер і місіс Девіс виторгували собі шлях до професорської ложі
трибун Гоґвортсу, де вони зручно влаштувалися з чудовим видом на зачакловані
екрани професора Квірела, щоб вони вдвох самі могли побачити "`що, о хитромудрі
шкрапетки, відбувається у цій школі, перепрошую за такі слова, заступнице директора
Макґонеґел!`"

// 13710
//Seated to the left of Mr. Davis was another concerned parent, a white-haired
//man in elegant black robes of unmatchable quality, one Lucius Malfoy, political
//leader of the strongest faction of the Wizengamot.
Ліворуч від містера Девіса сидів ще один стурбований батько -- біловолосий чоловік
в елегантній чорній мантії незрівнянної якості, такий собі Луціус Мелфой, політичний
лідер наймогутнішої фракції Чарверсуду.

// 13711
//To the left of Lord Malfoy, a sneeringly aristocratic man with a scarred face
//who had been introduced to them as Lord Jugson.
Ліворуч від лорда Мелфоя був зверхній аристократичний чоловік з пошрамованим лицем,
що був представлений як лорд Джаґсон.

// 13712
//Then an elderly but sharp-eyed fellow named Charles Nott, rumored to be nearly
//as wealthy as Lord Malfoy, seated on Lord Jugson’s left.
Далі сидів старший, та досі гострий на око чоловʼяга на імʼя Чарлз Нот, за чутками
ледь не такий саме заможний, як лорд Мелфой.

// 13713
//On the right of Mrs. Davis, one would find the comely Lady and yet handsomer
//Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass. Young they were as
//wizards counted age, garbed in grey silken robes set with tiny dark emeralds
//embroidered into the shape of grass blades. The Lady Greengrass was considered
//a key swing vote on the Wizengamot, her own mother having retired from the body
//with surprising speed. Her charming husband, though his family was not noble or
//wealthy of itself, had taken a seat on the Hogwarts Board of Governors.
Праворуч від місіс Девіс можна було побачити вродливу леді, і навіть більш
привабливого лорда шляхетного й найдавнішого роду Ґрінґрас. За мірками
чарівників вони були молодими, були вбрані у сірі шовкові мантії, які
прикрашали крихітними темні смарагдами у формі травинок. Леді Ґрінґрас мала
ключовий переламний голос у Чарверсуді, її матір відсторонилася від політики на
диво рано. Чарівний чоловік леді Ґрінґрас, хоч його власна родина й не була ані
шляхетною, ані заможною, отримав місце в раді опікунів Гоґвортсу.

// 13714
//To their right, a square-jawed and incredibly tough-looking old witch, who had
//shaken hands with Mr. and Mrs. Davis without the slightest hint of
//condescension. This was Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical Law
//Enforcement.
Праворуч від них була надзвичайно сувора стара відьма з квадратною щелепою.
Вона потисла була руки з містером і місіс Девіс без найменшого натяку на
зверхність. Це була Амелія Боунз, директорка Відділу Дотримання Магічних
Законів.

// 13715
//To Amelia’s right was a seniorish woman who had set the fashion scene of
//magical Britain on its ear by integrating a live vulture into her hat, one
//Augusta Longbottom. Though she was not addressed as Lady, Madam Longbottom
//would exercise the full rights of the Longbottom family for so long as their
//last scion had yet to attain his majority, and she was considered a prominent
//figure in a minority faction of the Wizengamot.
Праворуч від Амелії сиділа літня жінка, що якось на вуха поставила була моду
чаклунської Британії, коли вбудувала живого яструба в свій капелюх, така
собі Авґуста Лонґботом. Хоч вона й не мала титулу "`леді`", пані Лонґботом
в повній мірі могла застосовувати права родини Лонґботомів, доки їхній останній
нащадок не досягне повноліття, і її вважали яскравою фігурою в одній з менших фракцій
Чарверсуду.
//!4% 20.08

// 13716
//At the side of Madam Longbottom was seated none other than Chief Warlock
//Supreme Mugwump Headmaster Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, legendary
//defeater of Grindelwald, protector of Britain, rediscoverer of the fabled
//twelve uses of dragon’s blood, the most powerful wizard in the world &amp;c.;
Поряд з пані Лонґботом сидів сам головний маг, Верховний речник, директор Албус
Персіваль Вулфрик Браян Дамблдор, легендарний підкорювач Ґріндельвальда,
захисник Британії, перевинахідник славетних дванадцяти способів використання
драконячої крові, наймогутніший чарівник у світі тощо.

// 13717
//And finally, on the far right, one would find the enigmatic Defense Professor
//of Hogwarts, Quirinus Quirrell, who was leaning back on the cushioned benches
//as though resting; seeming entirely and naturally at ease in the rarefied
//company of a voting quorum of the Hogwarts Board of Governors, which had
//dropped by on this fine Saturday to learn just what the Fiddly-Snocks had been
//going on at Hogwarts in general and with Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Daphne
//Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Neville Longbottom in particular. The name of
//Harry Potter had also been much discussed.
// hedrok Fiddly-Snocks з 13709
І нарешті, останнім праворуч від них розташувався таємничий професор із захисту
Гоґвортсу, Квірін Квірел, що зараз спирався на мʼякі лави й ніби відпочивав.
Видавалося, він почувається як риба у воді серед витонченого товариства кворуму
ради опікунів Гоґвортсу, які просто вирішили зазирнути до школи цієї чудової суботи й
дізнатися, що ж, о хитромудрі шкрапетки, відбувається у Гоґвортсі взагалі, і з
Драко Мелфоєм, Теодором Нотом, Дафною Ґрінґрас, Сьюзен Боунз і Невілом Лонґботомом
зокрема. Імʼя Гаррі Поттера також згадувалося.

// 13718
//Oh, and one mustn’t forget Tracey Davis, of course. Director Bones’s eyebrows
//had climbed in some interest upon hearing the young couple introduced as her
//parents. Lord Jugson had given them a brief, incredulous stare before
//dismissing them with a snort. Lucius Malfoy had greeted them politely, his
//smile containing a hint of grim amusement mixed with pity.
О, і, звісно, не варто забувати про Трейсі Девіс. Брови директорки Боунз
здійнялися з деякою цікавістю, коли молоду пару представили, як її батьків.
Лорд Джаґсон швидко й скептично на них поглянув, пирхнув, і далі ігнорував їх.
Луціус Мелфой ґречно привітав їх, у його усмішці відчувалася суміш здивування
та зневаги.

// 13719
//Mr. and Mrs. Davis, whose last vote on anything of significance had been
//touching their wands to the name of Minister Fudge, who had all of three
//hundred Galleons stored in their Gringotts vault, and who respectively worked
//at selling cauldrons in a Potions shop and enchanting Omnioculars, were pressed
//up tightly against each other, sitting rigidly erect upon their cushioned
//benches, and desperately wishing they’d worn nicer robes.
// hedrok: Omnioculars -> всеноклі: Абабагаламага
Містер і місіс Девіс, що востаннє голосували з якогось важливого питання, коли
торкнулися паличками до імені міністра Фаджа, що зберігали всі свої триста
ґалеонів у сховищі "`Ґрінґотсу`", що працювали продавцем котлів у крамниці зіль
та заклинателькою всеноклів відповідно, притислися одне до одного й нерухомо
сиділи, якомога рівніше, на мʼяких лавах, і несамовито бажали, щоб вони одягли
були якісніші мантії.

// 13720
//The sky above was a solid mass of cloud dispersed into darker and lighter
//grays, grim with the promise of future storms; though no lightning flickered as
//yet, nor distant rumbles of thunder echoed; and only a few threatening droplets
//had fallen.
Небо над їхніми головами нагадувало суцільну хмару, що мала темніші й світліші
прошарки, невблаганно провіщало шторм. Хоча ще не блимнула жодна блискавка, не
було рокоту грому. Лише впало кілька загрозливих крапель.

***

// 13721
//To their designated starting place in a certain forest, the Sunshine Regiment
//marched, though it was really more like a slow walk; you wouldn’t want to tire
//yourself out before the battle even started, and the breezes of April were
//annoyingly humid, though cool. Ahead of them, a yellow flame wandered slowly
//through the air, guiding them according to their pace.
Полк "`Сонечко`" крокував до призначеного їм початкового місця в певному лісі,
хоча, можливо, фраза "`повільно йшов`" була б доречнішою. Не варто
втомлюватися, доки битва навіть не почалася, і квітневе повітря було неприємно
вогким, хоч і прохолодним. Поперед них повільно пересувалося зі швидкістю
їхньої ходи жовте полумʼя, що показувало напрямок.

// 13722
//Susan Bones kept throwing worried glances toward the Sunshine General as they
//marched through the grayly illuminated forest. Professor Snape’s going after
//Hermione seemed to have really shaken her. Hermione had even missed her
//Sunshine Regiment Official Planning Meeting, which seemed understandable
//enough; but when Susan had offered her sympathy afterward, Hermione had
//stammered that she’d lost track of time, which wasn’t at all a usual thing for
//her to say, and the girl had looked exhausted and frightened like she’d just
//spent three days locked in a bathroom stall with a Dementor. Even now, when all
//the Sunshine General’s focus should’ve been on the coming battle, the Ravenclaw
//girl’s gaze was constantly darting in all directions, as though she expected
//Dark Wizards to jump out of the bushes and sacrifice her.
Сьюзен Боунз повсякчас схвильовано зиркала на генерала Сонечка, доки вони крокували
забарвленим у сіре лісом. Видавалося, професор Снейп вибив був її з колії своїм
гриманням. Герміона навіть пропустила була "`офіційне віче з планування Полку
'`Сонечко`'"`, що легко було зрозуміти. Але коли після того Сьюзен спробувала
втішити Герміону, та пробурмотіла щось про те, що не встежила за часом, а це було
геть не в її стилі, крім того, дівчина здавалася виснаженою й переляканою, ніби
її замкнули на три дні в туалеті з дементором. Навіть зараз, коли генерал Сонечка
мала цілковито зосередитися на битві, рейвенкловка непрестанно роззиралася довкола,
ніби от-от чорні чаклуни мали вистрибнути з-за кущів й принести її в жертву.

// 13723
//“The ban on Muggle artifacts cuts down our options a lot,” Anthony Goldstein
//was saying in the dour tones the boy used to denote deliberate pessimism. “I
//had the idea of trying to Transfigure nets to throw on people, but -”
-- Заборона маґлівських артефактів сильно звужує наші можливості, --
сказав Ентоні Ґольдштейн понурим тоном, який завжди використовував для
навмисного песимізму. -- Мені якось спало на думку трансфігурувати
тенета, щоб кидати їх у людей, але..."

// 13724
//“No good,” said Ernie Macmillan. The Hufflepuff boy shook his head, looking
//even more serious than Anthony. “I mean, it’s just like throwing a hex, they’d
//__dodge__.”
-- Немає сенсу, -- сказав Ерні Макмілан. Гафелпафець похитав головою, він був
навіть серйознішим за Ентоні. -- Тобто, це ж як просто наслати прокльон -- вони
б просто __ухилилися__.

// 13725
//Anthony nodded. “That’s what I figured, too. Do you have any ideas, Seamus?”
-- Так, я теж так вирішив, -- кивнув Ентоні. -- А ти щось вигадав, Шеймусе?

// 13726
//The former Chaotic Lieutenant still looked a bit nervous and out-of-place,
//marching along with his new comrades in the Sunshine Regiment. “Sorry,” said
//the newly minted Captain Finnigan. “I’m more the strategic master type.”
Колишній лейтенант Хаосу досі почувався трохи не у своїй тарілці серед нових
товаришів Полку "`Сонечко`".

-- Вибачайте, -- сказав нещодавно призначений капітан Фініґан. -- Я більш
придатний для вигадування загальної стратегії.

// 13727
//“__I’m__ the strategic master type,” said Ron Weasley, sounding put-off.
-- Це __я__ вигадую загальну стратегію, -- обурено сказав Рон Візлі.

// 13728
//“There are __three__ armies,” the Sunshine General said acerbically,
//“which means we fight __two__ armies at once, which means we need more
//than one strategist, which means shut up, Ron!”
-- Тут __три__ війска, -- різко сказала генерал Сонечка, -- отже, ми
бʼємося з __двома__ військами водночас, відповідно, нам потрібно більше
за одного стратега, відповідно, стули пельку, Роне!

// 13729
//Ron gave their General a surprised and worried look. “Hey,” the Gryffindor boy
//said in a calming tone, “you shouldn’t let Snape get to you so much -”
Рон розгублено й стурбовано подивився на генерала.

-- Гей, -- заспокійливо сказав ґрифіндорець, -- не дозволяй Снейпові так на
себе впливати...

// 13730
//“What do __you__ think we ought to do, General?” Susan said very loudly
//and quickly. “I mean, we don’t really have a plan at this point.” Their
//official planning session had failed __amazingly__ with Hermione gone and
//both Ron and Anthony thinking they were in charge.
-- Генерале, а як __ви__ гадаєте, що нам варто робити? -- миттю дуже
гучно запитала Сьюзен. -- Тобто, наразі в нас насправді немає плану.

За відсутності Герміони їхня офіційна зустріч для планування провалилася була з
__тріском__, бо і Рон, і Ентоні, вважали, що вони головні.
//!8% 21.08

// 13731
//“Do we really need a plan?” the Sunshine General said, sounding a little
//distracted. “We’ve got you and me and Lavender and Parvati and Hannah and
//Daphne and Ron and Ernie and Anthony __and__ Captain Finnigan.”
-- А чи потрібен нам узагалі план? -- дещо неуважно сказала генерал Сонечка.
-- У нас є ти, я, Лаванда, Парваті, Анна, Дафна, Рон, Ерні, Ентоні __і__
капітан Фініґан.

// 13732
//“That -” began Anthony.
-- Це... -- почав Ентоні.

// 13733
//“Sounds like a pretty good strategy,” Ron said with an approving nod. “We’ve
//got as many strong soldiers now as both other armies put together. Chaos’s only
//got Potter and Longbottom and Nott left - well, and Zabini too, I suppose -”
-- Як на мене, доволі хороша стратегія, -- сказав Рон, схвально кивнувши. -- У
нас більше сильних солдатів, ніж у інших двох військ разом. У Хаосі залишилися
лише Поттер, Лонґботом та Нот... Ну, і, гадаю, Забіні...

// 13734
//“And Tracey,” said Hermione.
-- І Трейсі, -- сказала Герміона.

// 13735
//Several people swallowed nervously.
Кілька людей здригнулися.

// 13736
//“Oh, stop it,” Susan said sharply. “She’s just a battle-hardened member of
//S.P.H.E.W., that’s all General Sunshine means.”
-- Та годі вже, -- роздратовано сказала Сьюзен. -- Просто вона загартована в
боях учасниця С.С.Р.А.Г.Ч. -- це все, що мала на увазі генерал Сонечка.

// 13737
//“Still,” Ernie said, turning to look seriously at Susan, “I think you’d better
//go with whatever group fights Chaos, Captain Bones. I know you can’t use your
//double magical powers except when innocents are in danger, but I mean - just in
//case Miss Davis __does,__ you know, go out of control and try to eat
//someone’s soul -”
-- І все одно, -- сказав Ерні, серйозно поглянувши на Сьюзен, -- гадаю, тобі
ліпше піти з тим загоном, що битиметься з Хаосом, капітане Боунз. Знаю, що ти не
можеш використовувати свої подвійні чаклунські сили, хіба що невинні в
небезпеці, але, ну... на випадок, раптом міс Девіс __усе ж таки__, ну знаєте,
вийде з-під контролю й почне їсти чиїсь душі...

// 13738
//“I can handle her,” Susan told him, keeping her voice reassuring. Admittedly,
//Susan hadn’t been replaced by a Metamorphmagus at the moment, but then Tracey
//probably wasn’t Polyjuiced Dumbledore or whoever.
-- Я з нею впораюся, -- заспокійливо сказала Сьюзен. Так, її наразі не підміняла
метаморфмаг, але й Трейсі навряд чи зараз була багатозільнутим Дамблдором чи
кимось ще.

// 13739
//Captain Finnigan intoned in a deep, sort-of-rumbling voice, “I find your lack
//of skepticism disturbing.” He raised his hand with his thumb and forefinger
//almost touching, pointed at Ernie.
Капітан Фініган глибоким, дещо гуркотливим голосом вимовив речитативом:

-- Мене непокоїть твій брак скептицизму.

Він підвів руку, майже доторкнувся вказівним пальцем до великого, і вказав на
Ерні.

// 13740
//For some reason Anthony Goldstein seemed to be having a sudden choking fit.
//“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Ernie.
Ентоні Ґольдштейн чомусь почав кашляти.

-- І що це має означати? -- спитав Ерні.

// 13741
//“It’s just something General Potter says sometimes,” said Captain Finnigan.
//“Funny, when you first join the Chaos Legion it all seems crazy, and then after
//a couple of months you realize that actually everyone who __isn’t__ in the
//Chaos Legion is crazy -”
-- Просто генерал Поттер так подеколи каже, -- відповів капітан Фініґан. --
Кумедно: коли ти тілько-но потрапляєш у Легіон Хаосу, це все видається
божевіллям, та за кілька місяців ти розумієш, що насправді всі, хто __не__ в
Легіоні Хаосу -- божевільні...

// 13742
//“I __said__,” Ron said loudly, “it sounds like good strategy. We don’t
//Transfigure anything, we don’t tire ourselves out, we handle whatever they
//throw at us, and then we just overrun them.”
-- А __я кажу__, -- гучно промовив Рон, -- як на мене, це хороша стратегія.
Нічого не трансфігуруємо, не втомлюємося дарма, здолаємо все, що вони для нас
підготували, і потім просто переможемо їх силою.

// 13743
//“Okay,” said Hermione. “Let’s do that.”
-- Гаразд, -- сказала Герміона. -- Зробімо так.

// 13744
//“But -” said Anthony, shooting a glare at Ron. “But General, Harry Potter’s got
//__sixteen __people left in his army. Dragon and us each have twenty-eight.
//Harry knows that, he knows he’s got to come up with something incredible -”
-- Але... -- сказав Ентоні, люто глянувши на Рона. -- Але генерале, у Гаррі
Поттера залишилося лише __шістнадцять__ людей у військо. У нас та в Драконів по
двадцять вісім. Гаррі про це знає, він знає, що має вигадати щось дивовижне...

// 13745
//“Like what?” demanded Hermione, sounding stressed. “If we don’t know what he’s
//planning, we might as well save our magic for doing massed __Finites.__
//Like we should’ve done __last__ time!”
-- Наприклад? -- кинула Герміона, явно сама не своя. -- Якщо ми не знаємо, що
він замислив, нам краще берегти наші сили для масованих "`__Фініте__`". Як ми
мали зробити __минулого__ разу!

// 13746
//Susan touched Hermione gently on the shoulder. “General Granger?” said Susan.
//“I think you should take a break for a bit before the battle.”
Сьюзен обережно торкнулася плеча Герміони:

-- Генерале Ґрейнджер? Гадаю, вам варто трохи перепочити перед битвою.

// 13747
//She’d been expecting Hermione to argue, but Hermione just nodded and then
//walked a little faster, pulling away from the Sunshine Regiment Official
//Officer Group, her eyes still watching the forest, and sometimes the sky.
Вона гадала, що Герміона почне сперечатися, але та лише кивнула й наддала ходи.
Невдовзі вона залишила офіцерську групу Полку "`Сонечко`" позаду, її очі й далі
спостерігали за лісом, а інколи -- за небом.

// 13748
//Susan followed her. It wouldn’t do, having it look like the Sunshine General
//was being ejected from her own Official Officer Group.
Сьюзен пішла за нею. Не годиться, якщо здаватиметься, що генерала Сонечка
вигнали з її власної офіцерської групи.

//“Hermione?” Susan said softly, after they’d walked a bit away. “You’ve got to
//focus. Professor Quirrell’s in charge here, not Snape, and he won’t let
//anything bad happen to you or anyone.”
-- Герміоно? -- тихо гукнула Сьюзен, коли вони трохи відійшли. -- Тобі треба
зосередитися. Тут усім керує професор Квірел -- не Снейп, і він не дозволить
чомусь з тобою чи кимось ще статися.
//!12% 22.08

//“You’re not helping,” Hermione said, sounding shaky. “You’re not helping at
//all, Captain Bones.”
-- Це не допомагає, -- тремтячим голосом сказала Герміона. -- Зовсім не
допомагає, капітане Боунз.

// 13751
//The two of them walked faster, circling around some of the other soldiers,
//inspecting the marching perimeter and glancing at the surrounding trees.
Вони вдвох пішли ще швидше, вони обходили довкола якихось інших солдатів,
оглядали периметр та обводили поглядом дерева навкруги.

// 13752
//“Susan?” Hermione said in a small voice, when they’d gotten further away from
//all the others. “Do you think Daphne’s right about Draco Malfoy plotting
//something?”
-- Сьюзен? -- тихо спитала Герміона, коли вони ще більш віддалилися від решти.
-- Як гадаєш, Дафна має рацію щодо того, що Драко Мелфой має якийсь хитрий план?

// 13753
//“Yes,” Susan said at once, not even thinking about it. “You can tell, because
//his name’s got the letters M-A-L-F-O and Y in it.”
-- Так, -- миттєво відповіла Сьюзен, анітрохи не замислившись. -- Це очевидно,
бо його прізвище містить літери М-Е-Л-Ф-О та "`Й`".

// 13754
//Hermione looked around, as if to make sure that nobody was watching, although
//of course that was a wonderful way to get other people to pay attention to you.
//“Could Malfoy have been behind what Snape did?”
Герімона роззирнулася довкола, ніби хотіла пересвідчитися, що ніхто не
спостерігає, хоча, звісно, це був один з найліпших методів привернути увагу
інших людей. -- Чи міг Мелфой стояти за тим, що зробив Снейп?

// 13755
//“Snape could be behind Malfoy,” Susan said thoughtfully, remembering
//dinner-table conversations she’d heard at Auntie’s, “or Lucius Malfoy could be
//behind both of them.” A slight chill went down Susan’s spine as this last
//thought occurred to her. Suddenly, telling Hermione to just focus on the coming
//battle seemed a lot less reasonable. “Why, did you find some sort of clue about
//that?”
-- Снейп міг стояти за Мелфоєм, -- глибокодумно сказала Сьюзен, пригадуючи
розмови своєї тітоньки за столом, -- або Луціус Мелфой міг стояти за обома.

У неї спиною пробігли мурахи від цієї думки. Раптом порада Герміоні зосередитися
на битві здалася їй значно менш розумною.

-- А що, -- спитала вона, -- ти отримала якусь зачіпку щодо цього?

// 13756
//Hermione shook her head. “No,” the Ravenclaw girl said, in a voice that sounded
//almost like she was about to cry. “I was - just thinking about it myself -
//that’s all.”
Герміона похитала головою.

-- Ні, -- сказала рейвенкловка. Її голос звучав так, ніби вона от-от заплаче. --
Я... просто розмірковувала про це сама... от і все.

// 13757
//In their designated place in a forest near Hogwarts, the Dragon General and the
//warriors of Dragon Army waited where their red flame had led them, beneath grey
//skies.
У призначеному їм місці в лісі поряд з Гоґвортсом генерал Драконів та воїни
Армії Драконів чекали під сірими небесами там, куди їх привело їхнє червоне
полумʼя.

// 13758
//At Draco’s right side stood Padma Patil, his second-in-command, who had once
//led all of Dragon Army after Draco had been stunned. At Draco’s back was
//Vincent, the son of Crabbe, a family which had served the Malfoys into the
//distance of forgotten memory; the muscular boy was watchful as he was always
//watchful, whether battle had been declared or no. Further back, Gregory of the
//Goyles stood waiting beside one of the two broomsticks Dragon Army had been
//given; if the Goyles had not served the Malfoys so long as the Crabbes, yet
//they had served no less well.
Праворуч від Драко стояла Падма Патіл, його перша помічниця, що якось керувала
була усією Армією Драконів, коли Драко оглушили. За спиною Драко стояв Вінсент,
син Креба, -- з родини, що служила Мелфоям з незапамʼятних часів; кремезний хлопець
був пильним, адже він завжди був пильним, розпочалася вже битва чи ні. Ще трохи
позаду, поряд з двома мітлами, які видали Армії Драконів, був Ґреґорі з Ґойлів;
і хай Ґойли служили Мелфоям не так довго, як Креби, та служили вони не гірше.

// 13759
//And at Draco’s left side, now, stood one Dean Thomas of Gryffindor, a mudblood
//or possible half-blood who knew nothing of his father.
Ліворуч від Драко тепер стояв такий собі Дін Томас з Ґрифіндору -- бруднокровець
або, можливо, напівкровка -- він нічого не знав про свого батька.

// 13760
//Sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army had been a quite deliberate move on Harry’s
//part, Draco was certain. Three other former Chaotics had also been transferred
//to Dragon Army, and all were watching Draco hawklike to see if he offered the
//former Lieutenant the slightest insult.
Відправити Діна Томаса до Армії Драконів було зумисним ходом з боку Гаррі,
Драко в цьому не мав сумнівів. Ще трьох колишніх хаоситів перевели були до Армії
Драконів, і всі вони спостерігали за Драко, ніби яструби, чекали на найменшу
образу з боку Драко в бік колишнього лейтенанта.

// 13761
//Some might have called it sabotage, but Draco knew better. Harry had also sent
//Lieutenant Finnigan to the Sunshine Regiment, even though Professor Quirrell’s
//mandate had only required that Harry give up __one__ Lieutenant. That too
//had been a deliberate move, making crystal clear to everyone that Harry
//__wasn’t__ dumping his least-favored soldiers.
Дехто назвав би це саботажем, та Драко знав, що це не так. Гаррі також відправив
був лейтенанта Фініґана до Полку "`Сонечко`", хоча професор Квірел постановив,
що Гаррі має віддати лише __одного__ лейтенанта. Це Гаррі також зробив зумисно,
щоб усім було цілковито зрозуміло, що Гаррі __не__ виганяв найменш потрібних
солдатів.

// 13762
//In one sense, it might have been easier for Draco to win the true loyalties of
//his new soldiers if they’d thought Harry hadn’t wanted them. In another sense…
//well, it wasn’t easy to put into words. Harry had given him good soldiers with
//their pride intact, but it was more than that. Harry had showed kindliness
//toward his soldiers, but it was more than __that__. It wasn’t just Harry
//playing fair, it was something that… that you couldn’t help but contrast with
//the way the game was played in Slytherin House.
З одного боку, Драко було б легше здобути відданість нових солдатів, якби вони
гадали, що вони не потрібні Гаррі. З іншого боку... ну, це складно було
сформулювати. Гаррі віддав був йому хороших солдатів, не принизивши їх, але це
було ще не все. Гаррі виявив доброту до своїх солдатів, але навіть __це було ще не
все__. Справа була не в тому, що Гаррі грав чесно, а в тому що... неможливо було
не помітити разючу різницю з тим, як поводилися в таких випадках у Слизерині.

// 13763
//So Draco hadn’t offered the slightest insult to Mr. Thomas, but brought him
//straight to his side, subordinate to himself and Padma but no one else. It was
//a test, Draco had told Mr. Thomas and everyone, not a promotion. Mr. Thomas
//would have to show himself worthy of rank within Dragon Army - but he would be
//given a chance, and the chance __would__ be fair. Mr. Thomas had looked
//surprised at the ceremony of it (the Chaos Legion, from what Draco had heard,
//didn’t stand on formality) but the Gryffindor boy had stood a little
//straighter, and nodded.
Тож Драко не завдавав ані найменшої образи містерові Томасу, а натомість тримав
його поряд, підпорядкував лише собі й Падмі, і нікому більше. Це було
випробування, як сказав був Драко містерові Томасу й усім іншим, а не
підвищення. Містер Томас має продемонструвати, що він гідний звання в Армії
Драконів, але йому дадуть шанс, і цей шанс __буде__ справедливим. Містер Томас,
видавалося, був здивований через цю церемонію (як зрозумів Драко, у Легіоні
Хаосу все трималося не на формальностях), але ґрифіндорець трохи виструнчився й
кивнув.
//!16% 23.08

// 13764
//And then, after Mr. Thomas had done well enough in one of Dragon Army’s
//training sessions, he’d been brought into the strategy session in Dragon Army’s
//huge military office. And a few minutes into the session, Padma had happened to
//ask - as though it was a perfectly normal question - whether Mr. Thomas had any
//ideas about how to defeat the Chaos Legion.

// 13765
//The Gryffindor boy had said cheerfully that Harry had predicted that General
//Malfoy would get one of his soldiers to ask him that, and that Harry had given
//him the message that General Malfoy should ask himself where his relative
//advantage lay - what Draco Malfoy could do, or what Dragon Army could do, that
//the Chaos Legion couldn’t match - and then try to exploit it for all it was
//worth. Dean Thomas couldn’t think of what that advantage might be, but if he
//__did__ come up with any ideas for beating Chaos, he’d share them. Harry
//had ordered him to, after all.

// 13766
//__Sigh,__ Draco had thought, since he couldn’t actually sigh out loud. But
//it was good advice, and Draco had followed it, sitting at his bedroom desk with
//quill and parchment listing out everything that might be a relative advantage.

// 13767
//And, almost to Draco’s own surprise, he’d had an idea, a real one. In fact he’d
//had __two.__

// 13768
//The hollow bell sounded through the forest, somehow sounding more ominous than
//ever before. On the instant, the two pilots cried “__Up!__” and leapt onto
//their broomsticks, heading into the gray sky.

***

// 13769
//Mr. and Mrs. Davis had now slumped slightly against each other, more from sheer
//muscle exhaustion than from any decrease of tension. Before them, the vast
//blank white parchment flickered with three great windows, as though holes had
//been cut through into the forest, showing three armies on the march. Lesser
//windows showed the six riders upon their broomsticks, and the corner of the
//parchment showed a view of the entire forest, with glowing dots to indicate
//armies and scouts.

// 13770
//The window into Sunshine showed General Granger and her Captains marching in
//the center of the Sunshine Regiment, protected by __Contego__ screens
//along with a number of other young witches. The Sunshine Regiment, the Defense
//Professor had remarked, knew well that it had now acquired a strong advantage
//in experienced soldiers, and it meant to protect those soldiers from a surprise
//attack. Aside from that, the Sunshine Soldiers were moving forward at a steady
//march, conserving their strength.

// 13771
//The soldiers in General Malfoy’s army, at least those with higher
//Transfiguration scores, were picking up leaves and Transfiguring them into…
//well, if you looked at Padma Patil, who was almost done with hers, it looked
//like her leaf was becoming a left-handed glove bearing a dangling strap. (The
//window had zoomed in to show this.)

// 13772
//Lord Jugson was watching the screen with a flat expression; his voice, when he
//spoke, seemed to ooze and drip with disdain. “What __is__ your son doing,
//Lucius?”

// 13773
//The foreign-born witch who stood at Draco Malfoy’s right side had finished
//Transfiguring her glove, and was now bringing it before the Dragon General like
//a sacrifice.

// 13774
//“I do not know,” said Lucius Malfoy, his tone calm though no less aristocratic,
//“but I must trust that he has good reason for doing it.”

// 13775
//All Dragon Army stopped for a moment as Padma slid the glove over her left
//hand, strapped it in place, and presented it before Draco Malfoy; who also
//stopped in place, took several deep breaths, raised his wand, executed a
//precise set of eight movements and bellowed “__Colloportus!__”

// 13776
//The Dragon Warrior raised her gloved hand, flexed it, and gave a small bow to
//Draco Malfoy, who returned it more shallowly, though the Dragon General was
//staggering slightly. Padma then returned to her place at Draco’s side, and the
//Dragons began marching once more.

// 13777
//“Well,” remarked Augusta Longbottom. “I don’t suppose someone would care to
//explain?” Amelia Bones was frowning slightly as she gazed at the screen.

// 13778
//“For some reason or other,” said the amused voice of Professor Quirrell, “it
//seems that the scion of Malfoy is able to cast surprisingly strong magic for a
//first-year student. Due to the purity of his blood, of course. Certainly the
//good Lord Malfoy would not have openly flouted the underage magic laws by
//arranging for his son to receive a wand before his acceptance into Hogwarts.”
//!20% 24.08

// 13779
//“I suggest you be careful in your implications, Quirrell,” Lucius Malfoy said
//coldly.

// 13780
//“Oh, I am,” Professor Quirrell said. “A __Colloportus__ cannot be
//dispelled by __Finite Incantatem;__ it requires an __Alohomora__ of
//equal strength. Until then, a glove so Charmed will resist lesser material
//forces, deflect the Sleep Hex and the Stunning Hex. And as neither Mr. Potter
//nor Miss Granger can cast a counterspell powerful enough, that Charm is
//invincible upon this battlefield. It is not the original intent of the Charm,
//nor the intent of whoever taught Mr. Malfoy an emergency spell for evading his
//enemies. But it would seem that Mr. Malfoy has been learning creativity.”

// 13781
//Lucius Malfoy had straightened as the Defense Professor spoke; he now sat erect
//upon his cushioned bench, his head held perceptibly higher than before, and
//when he spoke it was with quiet pride. “He will be the greatest Lord Malfoy
//that has yet lived.”

// 13782
//“Faint praise,” Augusta Longbottom said under her breath; Amelia Bones
//chuckled, as did Mr. Davis for a tiny, fatal fraction of a second before he
//stopped with a strangled gargle.

// 13783
//“I quite agree,” said Professor Quirrell, though it wasn’t clear to whom he
//spoke. “Unfortunately for Mr. Malfoy, he is still new to the art of creativity,
//and so he has committed a classic error of Ravenclaw.”

// 13784
//“And what might that be?” said Lucius Malfoy, his voice now turned chill once
//more.

// 13785
//Professor Quirrell had leaned back in his seat, the pale blue eyes briefly
//unfocusing as one of the windows shifted its viewpoint within the greater
//screen, zooming in to show the sweat now on Draco Malfoy’s forehead. “It is
//such a beautiful idea that Mr. Malfoy has quite overlooked its pragmatic
//difficulties.”

// 13786
//“Would someone care to explain that?” said Lady Greengrass. “Not all of us
//present are experts at such… affairs.”

// 13787
//Amelia Bones spoke, the old witch’s voice somewhat dry. “It will tempt them to
//try to catch hexes that they would be wiser to simply dodge. The more so, if
//they have had little practice catching them. And the casting of so many Charms
//will tire their strongest warrior.”

// 13788
//Professor Quirrell gave the DMLE Director a half-nod of acknowledgment. “As you
//say, Madam Bones. Mr. Malfoy is new to the business of having ideas, and so
//when he has one, he becomes proud of himself for having it. He has not yet had
//enough ideas to unflinchingly discard those that are beautiful in some aspects
//and impractical in others; he has not yet acquired confidence in his own
//ability to think of better ideas as he requires them. What we are seeing here
//is not Mr. Malfoy’s best idea, I fear, but rather his only idea.”

// 13789
//Lord Malfoy simply turned to watch the screens again, as though the Defense
//Professor had used up his right to exist.

// 13790
//“But -” said Lord Greengrass. “But what in Merlin’s name is Harry Potter -”

// 13791
//Sixteen remaining soldiers of the Chaos Legion - or fifteen plus Blaise Zabini,
//rather - marched confidently through the forest, their shoes thudding over the
//still-dry ground. Their camouflage uniforms blended into the forest even more
//than usual, all colors washed out by the tints of an overcast day.

// 13792
//Sixteen Chaos Legionnaires, against twenty-eight Dragon Warriors and
//twenty-eight Sunshine Soldiers.

// 13793
//The common consensus had been that, with odds that bad, it was practically
//impossible for them to lose. After all, General Chaos was bound to come up with
//something really __spectacular,__ facing odds like that.

// 13794
//There was something almost nightmarish about how everyone seemed to now expect
//Harry to pull miracles out of his hat, on demand, any time one was needed. It
//meant that if you couldn’t do the impossible, you were __disappointing
//your friends__ and __failing to live up to your potential…__

// 13795
//Harry hadn’t bothered complaining to Professor Quirrell about ‘too much
//pressure’. Harry’s mental model of the Defense Professor had predicted him
//looking severely annoyed, saying things along the lines of __You are
//perfectly capable of solving this problem, Mr. Potter; did you even try?__ and
//then deducting several hundred Quirrell points.

// 13796
//From above, from where two broomsticks watched their march, the high young
//voice of Tess Walsh cried “Friend!” and after another moment, “Gingersnap!”

// 13797
//A handful of seconds later, the soldier who’d code-named herself Gingersnap
//returned bearing a double handful of acorns, sweating slightly in the cool but
//humid air from the jog that had taken her to the oak tree Neville had spotted.
//Gingersnap approached to where Shannon was holding a uniform-shirt with the
//neck tied off, in lieu of anyone having to Transfigure a bag. When Gingersnap
//brought her hands forward to try and dump her acorns into the holding-shirt,
//Chaotic Shannon, giggling, jerked the shirt to the right, then to the left
//again as Gingersnap made another effort to dump the acorns, until a sharp “Miss
//Friedman!” from Lieutenant Nott caused Shannon to sigh and hold the shirt
//still. Gingersnap dumped her acorns into those accumulated, and then headed out
//for more.

// 13798
//Somewhere in the background, Ellie Knight was singing her very own version of
//the Chaos Legion’s marching song, and around half the other soldiers were
//trying to step along with it despite not knowing the tune in advance. Nearby,
//Nita Berdine, who had a high Transfiguration score, finished creating yet
//another pair of green sunglasses, and handed them to Adam Beringer, who folded
//up the sunglasses before tucking them into his uniform pocket. Other soldiers
//were already wearing their own green sunglasses, despite the cloudy day.

// 13799
//You might guess that there was some sort of incredibly complicated and
//fascinating explanation behind this, and you would be right.

// 13800
//Two days earlier Harry had been sitting amid his bookcases in the comfy
//rocking-chair he’d obtained for his trunk’s cavern level, pondering silently in
//the quiet span between classes and dinnertime, thinking about power.

// 13801
//For sixteen Chaotics to defeat twenty-eight Sunnies and twenty-eight Dragons
//they would need a force amplifier. There were limits to what you could do with
//maneuver. There __had__ to be a secret weapon and it had to be invincible,
//or at least moderately unstoppable.

// 13802
//Muggle artifacts were now illegal in Hogwarts’s mock battles, banned by
//Ministry edict. And the trouble with finding some other clever and unusual
//spell was that an army twice your own size could brute-force __Finite
//__almost anything you tried. The Sunshine Regiment might have missed that tactic
//with the Transfigured chainmail, but nobody would miss it again now that
//Professor Quirrell had pointed it out. And __Finite Incantatem__ was a
//brute-force counterspell which required at least as much magic as the spell
//being canceled… which, if you were severely outnumbered, made it a whole new
//order of military challenge. The enemy could __Finite__ anything you
//tried, and still have enough magic left over for shields and volleys of Sleep
//Hexes.

// 13803
//Unless, somehow, you could invoke potencies beyond the ordinary strength of
//first-year Hogwarts students, something too powerful for the enemy to
//__Finite__.

// 13804
//So Harry had asked Neville if he’d ever heard of any __small, safe__
//sacrificial rituals -

// 13805
//And then, after the screaming and the shouting had subsided, after Harry had
//stopped trying to argue about Unbreakable Vows and just given up the whole
//thing as impossible from a public relations standpoint, Harry had realized that
//he hadn’t even needed to go there. They taught you how to invoke potencies far
//beyond your own strength in ordinary Hogwarts classes.

// 13806
//Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, you didn’t
//realize __what__ you were looking at until you happened to ask exactly the
//right question.

// 13807
//__Defense. Charms. Transfiguration. Potions. History of Magic. Astronomy.

//It was a good thing that Neville Longbottom hadn’t the tiniest idea that his
//grandmother was watching; or he would’ve been more self-conscious about
//screaming scary battlecries at the top of his lungs while casting
//__Luminos__ every three seconds as he rocketed through a dense forest of

//(“But -” Augusta Longbottom said, her expression showing almost as much
//astonishment as worry. “But Neville is afraid of heights!”)

// 13811

//Chaos Legion still marched.

// 13815
//Twenty seconds later - it hadn’t been a long chase, just an __exciting__
//one - Neville was back among his fellow Chaotics, and dismounted his broom to
//walk on the ground for a little bit.

// 13816
//“Neville -” said General Potter. Harry’s voice was a little distant, as he
//walked carefully and steadily through the forest, his wand still applied to the
//almost-finished Form of the object he was slowly Transfiguring. Beside him,
//Blaise Zabini, working a smaller version of the same Transfiguration, looked
//like a shambling Inferi as he stumbled forward. “I told you - Neville - you
//don’t have to -”

// 13817
//“Yes, I do,” said Neville. He looked down at where his fingers grasped the
//broomstick, and saw that not just his hands, but his whole arms were shaking.
//But unless anyone else in Chaos had been practicing dueling for an hour a day
//with Mr. Diggory, and then practicing their aim in private for another hour
//afterward, Neville was probably the best shot from a broomstick even after
//taking into account that he wasn’t a very good flyer.

// 13818
//“Good show, Neville,” Theodore said from where he was walking ahead of them
//all, leading the Chaos Legion forward through the forest while wearing only his
//undershirt.

// 13819
//(Augusta Longbottom and Charles Nott exchanged brief astonished glances and
//then wrenched their gazes away from one another as though stung.)

// 13820
//Neville took a few deep breaths, trying to steady his hands, trying to think;
//Harry might not be good for deep strategic thinking while he was in the middle
//of an extended Transfiguration. “Lieutenant Nott, do you have any idea why
//Dragon Army just did that? They lost a broom -” The Dragons had started the
//combat with a feint to provide a distraction for Mr. Goyle’s approach through
//the forest; Neville hadn’t realized there were __two__ brooms attacking
//until almost too late. But the Chaos Legion had __gotten__ the other
//pilot. That was why broomsticks usually didn’t attack before armies met, it
//meant a whole army would concentrate fire on the broomstick. “And the Dragons
//didn’t even get anyone, did they?”

// 13821
//“Nope!” Tracey Davis said proudly. She too was now marching by General Potter’s
//side, her wand gripped low and watchful as her eyes scanned the surrounding
//forest. “I threw up a Prismatic Sphere like a split second before Mr. Goyle’s
//hex got Zabini, and the way Mr. Goyle had his other arm stretched out I think
//he planned to knock down the General, too.” The Slytherin witch smiled with
//vicious confidence. “Mr. Goyle tried a Breaking Drill Hex, but learned to his
//dismay that his weak magic was no match for my newfound dark powers, hahahaha!”

// 13822
//Some Chaotics laughed with her, but a queasy sensation was starting in

//than Potter’s. I couldn’t get either of them or disrupt their Transfigurations,
//Tracey Davis blocked me. Neville Longbottom is on a broomstick and he’s still a
//terrible flyer but his aim is really good.”

// 13825
//Draco listened, frowning, and then he glanced at Padma and Dean Thomas, who
//both shook their own heads, indicating that they also couldn’t think of what
//might be big and grey and shaped like a cauldron.

// 13826
//“Anything else?” said Draco. If that was it, they’d lost a broom for nothing -

// 13827
//“The only other weird thing I saw,” Gregory said, sounding puzzled, “was that
//some Chaotics were wearing… sort of like goggles?”

// 13828
//Draco thought about this, not noticing that he’d stopped marching or that all
//of Dragon Army had automatically stopped with him.

// 13829
//“Was there anything special about the goggles?” Draco said.

// 13830
//“Um…” Gregory said. “They were… greenish, maybe?”

// 13831
//“Okay,” said Draco. Again without thinking, he began walking once more and his
//Dragons followed. “Here’s our new strategy. We’re only going to send eleven
//Dragons against the Chaos Legion, not fourteen. That should be enough to beat
//them, now that we can neutralize their special advantage.” It was a gamble, but
//you had to take gambles sometimes, if you wanted to come in first in a
//three-way battle.

// 13832
//“You figured out Chaos’s plan, General Malfoy?” said Mr. Thomas with
//considerable surprise.

// 13833
//“What are they doing?” said Padma.

// 13834
//“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said Draco, with a smirk of the most refined
//smugness. “We’ll just do the obvious thing.”

//Harry, having now finished his cauldron, was carefully scooping acorns into the
//container while the scouts searched for a nearby source of water that could be
//used as a liquid base. They’d come across frequent sinkholes and miniature
//creeks in the forest before, so it ought not to take long. Another scout had
//brought a straight stick that would serve as a stirrer, so Harry didn’t have to
//Transfigure one.

// 13836
//Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, you didn’t
//realize __what__ you were looking at until you happened to ask exactly the
//right question…

// 13837
//__How can I invoke magical powers that ought to be beyond the reach of
//first-year students?__

// 13838
//There was a cautionary tale the Potions Master had told them (with much sneers
//and laughter to make the stupidity seem low-status instead of daring and
//romantic) about a second-year witch in Beauxbatons who’d stolen some extremely
//restricted and expensive ingredients, and tried to brew Polyjuiceso she could
//borrow the form of another girl for purposes better left unmentioned. Only
//she’d managed to contaminate the potion with __cat hairs,__ and then
//instead of seeking a healer immediately, the witch had hidden herself in a
//bathroom, hoping the effects would just wear off; and when she’d finally been
//found, it had been too late to reverse the transformation completely,
//condemning her to a life of despair as a sort of cat-girl hybrid.
//!36% 28.08

// 13839
//Harry hadn’t realized what that__ meant__ until the instant of thinking
//the right question - but what that implied was that a young wizard or witch
//could do things with Potions-Making that they couldn’t even come close to doing
//with Charms. Polyjuice was one of the most potent potions known… but what made
//Polyjuice a N.E.W.T.-level potion, apparently, wasn’t the required age before
//you had enough magical power; it was how difficult the potion was to brew
//precisely and what happened to you if you screwed up.

// 13840
//Nobody in any army had tried brewing any potions up until then. But Professor
//Quirrell would let you get away with nearly anything, if it was something you
//could also have done in a real war. __Cheating is technique,__ the Defense
//Professor had once lectured them. __Or rather, cheating is what the
//losers call technique, and will be worth extra Quirrell points when executed
//successfully. __In principle, there was nothing unrealistic about Transfiguring
//a couple of cauldrons and brewing potions out of whatever came to hand, if you
//had enough time before the armies met.

// 13841
//So Harry had retrieved his copy of __Magical Drafts and Potions,__ and
//begun looking for a safe but useful potion he could brew in the minutes before
//the battle started - a potion which would win the battle too fast for
//counterspells, or produce spell effects too strong for first-years to
//__Finite.__

// 13842
//Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, you didn’t
//realize __what__ you were looking at until you happened to ask exactly the
//right question…

// 13843
//__What potion can I brew using only components gathered from an ordinary
//forest?__

// 13844
//Every recipe in __Magical Drafts and Potions__ used at least one
//ingredient from a magical plant or animal. Which was unfortunate, because all
//the __magical__ plants and animals were in the Forbidden Forest, not the
//safer and lesser woods where battles were held.

// 13845
//Someone else might have given up at that point.

// 13846
//Harry had turned the pages from one recipe to another, skimming faster and
//faster in dawning realization, confirming what he had already read and was now
//__seeing__ for the first time.

// 13847
//Every single Potions recipe seemed to demand at least one magical ingredient,
//__but why should that be true?__

// 13848
//Charms required no material components at all; you just said the words and
//waved your wand. Harry had been thinking about Potions-Making as essentially
//analogous: Instead of your spoken syllables triggering a spell effect for no
//comprehensible reason, you collected a batch of disgusting ingredients and
//stirred four times clockwise, and that arbitrarily triggered a spell effect.

// 13849
//In which case, given that most potions used ordinary components like porcupine
//quills or stewed slugs, you’d expect to see some potions using __only__
//ordinary components.

// 13850
//But instead every single recipe in __Magical Drafts and Potions__ demanded
//at least __one__ component from a magical plant or animal - an ingredient
//like silk from an Acromantula or petals from a Venus Fire Trap.

// 13851
//Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, you didn’t
//realize __what__ you were looking at until you happened to ask exactly the
//right question…

// 13852
//__If making a potion is like casting a Charm, why don’t I fall over from
//exhaustion after brewing a draught as powerful as boil-curing?__

// 13853
//The Friday before last, Harry’s double Potions class had brewed __potion
//of boil-curing…__ although even the most trivial healing Charms, if you tried to
//cast them with wand and incantation, were at least fourth-year spells. And
//afterward, they’d all felt the way they usually felt after Potions class,
//namely, __not__ magically exhausted to any discernible degree.

// 13854
//Harry had shut his copy of __Magical Drafts and Potions__ with a snap, and
//rushed down to the Ravenclaw common room. Harry had found a seventh-year
//Ravenclaw doing his N.E.W.T. potions homework and paid the older boy a Sickle
//to borrow __Moste Potente Potions __for five minutes; because Harry hadn’t
//wanted to run all the way to the library to find confirmation.
//!40% 29.08

// 13855
//After skimming through five recipes in the seventh-year book, Harry had read
//the sixth recipe, for a __potion of fire breathing__, which required
//Ashwinder eggs… and the book warned that the resulting fire could be no hotter
//than the magical fire which had spawned the Ashwinder which had laid the eggs.

// 13856
//Harry had shouted “__Eureka!__” right in the middle of the Ravenclaw
//common room, and been severely rebuked by a nearby prefect, who’d thought Mr.
//Potter was trying to cast a spell. Nobody in the wizarding world knew or cared
//about some ancient Muggle named Archimedes, nor the ur-physicist’s realization
//that the water displaced from a bathtub would equal the volume of the object
//entering the bathtub…

// 13857
//Conservation laws. They’d been the critical insight in more Muggle discoveries
//than Harry could easily count. In Muggle technology you couldn’t raise a
//feather one meter off the ground without the power coming from
//__somewhere.__ If you looked at molten lava spilling from a volcano and
//asked where the heat came from, a physicist would tell you about radioactive
//heavy metals in the center of the Earth’s molten core. If you asked where the
//energy to power the radioactivity came from, the physicist would point to an
//era before the Earth had formed, and a primordial supernova in the early days
//of the galaxy which had baked atomic nuclei heavier than the natural limit, the
//supernova compressing protons and neutrons into a tight unstable package that
//yielded back some of the supernova’s energy when it split. A light bulb was
//fueled by electricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant, fueled by a supernova…
//You could play the game all the way back to the Big Bang.

// 13858
//Magic did __not__ appear to work like this, to put it mildly. Magic’s
//attitude toward laws like Conservation of Energy was somewhere between a giant
//extended middle finger, and a shrug of total indifference. __Aguamenti__
//created water out of nothingness, so far as anyone knew; there was no known
//lake whose water level went down each time. That was a simple fifth-year spell,
//not considered impressive by wizards, because creating a mere glass of water
//didn’t seem amazing to them. They didn’t have the wacky notion that mass ought
//to be conserved, or that creating a gram of mass was somehow equivalent to
//creating 90,000,000,000,000 joules of energy. There was an upper-year spell
//Harry had run across whose __literal incantation__ was ‘__Arresto
//Momentum!’__ and when Harry had asked if the momentum went anywhere
//__else__ he’d just gotten a puzzled look. Harry had kept an increasingly
//desperate eye out for __some__ kind of conservation principle in magic,
//anywhere whatsoever…

// 13859
//…and the whole time it had been right in front of him in every Potions class.
//Potions-Making didn’t __create__ magic, it __preserved__ magic, that
//was why every potion needed at least one magical ingredient. And by following
//instructions like ‘stir four times counterclockwise and once clockwise’ - Harry
//had hypothesized - you were doing something like casting a small spell that
//reshaped the magic in the ingredients. (And unbound the physical form so that
//ingredients like porcupine quills dissolved smoothly into a drinkable liquid;
//Harry strongly suspected that a Muggle following exactly the same recipe would
//end up with nothing but a spiny mess.) That was what Potions-Making really
//__was,__ the art of transforming existing magical essences. So you were a
//little tired after Potions class, but not much, because you weren’t empowering
//the potions yourself, you were just reshaping magic that was already there. And
//that was why a second-year witch could brew Polyjuice, or at least get close.

// 13860
//Harry had kept scanning through __Moste Potente Potions,__ looking for
//something that might disprove his shiny new theory. After five minutes he’d
//flipped the older boy another Sickle (over his protests) and kept going.

// 13861
//The __potion of giant strength__ required a Re’em to trample the mashed
//Dugbogs you stirred into the potion. It was odd, Harry had realized after a
//moment, because crushed Dugbogs weren’t strong themselves, they were just…
//very, very crushed after the Re’em got through with them.

// 13862
//Another recipe said to ‘touch with forged bronze’, i.e., grasp a Knut in pliers
//so you could skim the potion’s surface; and if you dropped the Knut all the way
//in, the book warned, the potion would instantly superheat and boil over the
//cauldron.

// 13863
//Harry had stared at the recipes and their warnings, forming a second and
//stranger hypothesis. Of course it wouldn’t be as simple as Potions-Making using
//magical potentials imbued in the ingredients, like Muggle cars fueled by the
//combustion potential of gasoline. Magic would never be as sensible as that…

// 13864
//And then Harry had gone to Professor Flitwick - since he didn’t want to
//approach Professor Snape outside of class - and Harry had told Professor
//Flitwick that he wanted to invent a new potion, and he knew what the
//ingredients ought to be and what the potion should do, but he didn’t know how
//to deduce the required stirring pattern -
//!44% 30.08

// 13865
//After Professor Flitwick had stopped screaming in horror and running in little
//circles, and Professor McGonagall had been called into the ensuing fierce
//interrogation to promise Harry that in this case it was both acceptable and
//important for him to reveal his underlying theory, it had developed that Harry
//had not made an original magical discovery, but rediscovered a law so ancient
//that nobody knew who had first formulated it:

// 13866
//__A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of its
//ingredients.__

// 13867
//The heat of goblin forges that had cast the bronze Knut, the Re’em’s strength
//that had crushed the Dugbogs, the magical fire that had spawned the Ashwinder:
//all these potencies could be recalled, unlocked, and restructured by the
//spell-like process of stirring the ingredients in exact patterns.

// 13868
//(From a Muggle standpoint it was just __odd,__ a deranged version of
//thermodynamics invented by someone who thought life ought to be __fair__.
//From a Muggle standpoint, the heat expended in forging the Knut hadn’t gone
//into the bronze, the heat had left and dissipated into the environment,
//becoming permanently less available. Energy was conserved, could be neither
//created nor destroyed; __entropy__ always increased. But wizards didn’t
//think that way: from their perspective, if you’d put some amount of work into
//making a Knut, it stood to reason that you could get exactly the same work back
//out. Harry had tried to explain why this sounded a bit odd if you’d been raised
//by Muggles, and Professor McGonagall had asked bemusedly why the Muggle
//perspective was any better than the wizarding one.)

// 13869
//The fundamental principle of Potions-Making had no name and no standard
//phrasing, since then you might be tempted to write it down.

// 13870
//And someone who wasn’t wise enough to figure out the principle themselves might
//read it.

// 13871
//And they would start having all sorts of bright ideas for inventing new
//Potions.

// 13872
//And then they would be turned into catgirls.

// 13873
//It had been made very clear to Harry that he wasn’t going to be sharing this
//particular discovery with Neville, or Hermione either after the next armies’
//battle. Harry had tried to say something about Hermione seeming really off
//lately and this being just the sort of thing that might cheer her up. Professor
//McGonagall had said flatly that he wasn’t even to think it, and Professor
//Flitwick had raised his little hands and made a gesture as of snapping a wand
//in half.

// 13874
//Although the two Professors had been kind enough to suggest that if Mr. Potter
//thought he knew what the potion’s ingredients should be, he might be able to
//find an already-existing recipe that did the same thing; and Professor Flitwick
//had mentioned several volumes in the Hogwarts library that might be useful…

//“We’ll both take him at once,” Daphne whispered. She knew that a few

//might not be enough to match Neville’s regular dueling practice with Harry and
//Cedric Diggory over the same period. “He’s too much for one of us, but both of
//us together - I’ll use my Charm, you just try to stun him -”

// 13920
//Hannah, beside her, nodded, and then they both screamed at the top of their

//moving them faster and making them light on their feet, Daphne already crying
//“__Tonare!__” even as Hannah kept a huge __Contego__ shield moving in

//(Photographs were strictly prohibited at all Hogwarts games, but somehow this

  //slightest traces of hesitation, Hannah fired her first Sleep Hex at Neville
//(she’d started the incantation while she was still in the air) even as Daphne,
//concentrating more on speed than on force, slashed down with her Ancient Blade
//at where she thought Neville’s thighs would be __after__ he dodged -

//__fell too fast__ and when his Blade smashed into hers it was like being

//been all over for her, then, if Neville hadn’t landed too hard himself and gone
//to his knees with a pained gasp. And then before Neville could bring his
//glowing Blade down, Hannah shouted “__Somnium!__” and Neville lurched
//frantically backward - though of course no spell had actually come from
//Hannah’s wand, the Hufflepuff girl couldn’t really have fired again that fast -

//into a game which involves actual spellcasting.”

//“__Expelliarmus!__” shouted Draco, trying not to let his voice crack as he
//simultaneously dodged the blazing red stunbolt that Hermione Granger had fired
//at him, his muscles twisting with the need to dodge in the wrong direction -
//she’d pointed to his left, and then with a mysterious twitch fired right -

// 13928
//Hermione dodged the fast-moving dueling hex, and cried with hardly another
//moment’s pause, “__Steleus!__”, a wide-angle Hex that Draco couldn’t
//avoid, but he managed to point his wand at his own face and cry
//”__Quiescus!__” before the sudden urge to inhale could devolve into a
//sneezing fit that would’ve ended the battle.

// 13929
//Draco Malfoy was already half-exhausted from all the Locking Charms and
//Transfigurations earlier, but his confusion was beginning to give way to a
//sense of his own blood boiling, he didn’t know why Granger was attacking him so
//angrily all of a sudden, but __if she wanted a fight he’d give her one -__

// 13930
//(The Dragons and Sunnies weren’t stopping to watch the duel of their Generals,
//the Dragons were too disciplined to stop and watch and that meant the Sunnies
//had to go on fighting too; but the gaping audience in the Hogwarts Quidditch
//stands were being distracted even from Neville and Daphne’s spectacle, shifting
//their eyes to the duel of two Generals as Malfoy and Granger fired hex after
//hex and jinx after jinx at each other, casting more rapidly than any other
//student in their year could have managed, the Dragon General’s trained dueling
//dance matched by the Sunshine General’s frantic energy, the combat between them
//beginning to resemble an adult duel as the two most magically powerful
//first-years resorted to spells more exotic than the usual Sleep Hex.)
//!60% 03.09

//bowl of wet grapes, they’d never seen her __angry.__

***

// 13932
//Daphne lashed out with her Ancient Blade, again not trying to hit hard but just
//moving the Blade as fast as possible, at the same time Hannah cried
//“__Somnium!__” and Neville leapt back again, but it had been another bluff
//and Hannah was moving in to fire a real spell almost point-blank -

// 13933
//- and Neville Longbottom did exactly what - he would explain afterward - Cedric
  //Diggory had trained him to do if he was fighting Bellatrix Black, which was
//to spin around and kick Hannah __really hard__ in the pit of her stomach.

// 13934
//The Hufflepuff girl made a sad little sound, a gasping cry of pain, as she was
//knocked off her feet by the hard shoe sinking into her abdomen with the force
//of Neville’s whole body behind it.

// 13935
//For an instant the battlefield stood still, everything halted except Hannah’s
//falling form.

// 13936
//Then Neville’s face turned to absolute dismay and he lowered his wand, the
//Chaotic Lieutenant starting instinctively toward his House-mate as he reached
//for her with his other hand -

// 13937
//Even as Hannah turned her fall into a roll and came out with her wand raised
//and shot him.

// 13938
//A fractional second later, Daphne, who hadn’t hesitated either, sank her Most
//Ancient Blade squarely into Neville’s back, causing the Chaotic Lieutenant’s
//muscles to jerk convulsively with the stunning magic discharging into him even
//as Hannah’s Sleep Hex took effect, and then the last scion of Longbottom was
//sprawled still on the ground with a look of total surprise frozen to his face.

***

// 13939
//“Today Mr. Longbottom has learned a valuable lesson about his feelings of pity
//and remorse,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 13940
//“And chivalry,” said Amelia, sipping her tea again.

***

// 13941
//“Are you all right?” whispered Daphne, as she stood protectively over where
//Hannah lay on the ground clutching her stomach. The girl didn’t give anything
//back in reply except more retching sounds that sounded like Hannah was trying
//not to throw up while trying not to cry.

// 13942
//Somehow, even though it might not have been good tactics - it would’ve been
//better if Hannah had been hexed outright, than for other soldiers to be tied up
//protecting her - a number of Sunnies seemed to be standing in front of Hannah
//with their wands clutched tightly, staring angrily at the Chaotics. Someone had
//thrown up a Prismatic barrier between the two groups, Daphne couldn’t see who.

// 13943
//And for some reason the Chaotics didn’t seem to be pressing the attack. Even
//Tracey had completely dropped the grim look on her face and was shifting her
//weight nervously from one foot to another, as though she was having trouble
//remembering which side she was on -

// 13944
//“__Hold!__” shouted a voice. ”__Hold battle!__”

// 13945
//There wasn’t much battle going on anyway, but it held.

// 13946
//General Potter, looking every inch the Boy-Who-Lived, strode out from the trees
//with something large and camouflage-cloth-covered held under one arm.

// 13947
//“Is Miss Abbott breathing all right?” General Potter yelled.
//!64% 04.09

// 13948
//Daphne didn’t look back. She didn’t trust that this wasn’t a trap - it was
//absolutely certain that if the Chaotics took the opportunity to attack,
//Professor Quirrell would not only rule it legal but also award them extra
//points afterward. But Daphne could hear the answer well enough with her ears,
//it wasn’t like Hannah was trying to breathe __quietly__, and so she said,
//“Sort of.”

// 13949
//“She should get out of here and to someone who can use healing Charms,” Harry
//said. “Just in case that broke something.”

// 13950
//From behind Daphne, a small gasping voice said, “I - can - still - fight -”

// 13951
//“Miss Abbott, don’t -” Harry said, just as there was the sound from behind
//Daphne of someone collapsing back to the grass after trying and failing to get
//to her feet. Everyone winced, but Daphne didn’t turn her back on Harry.

// 13952
//“Why haven’t the teachers stopped the battle?” said Susan, her voice angry.

// 13953
//“I expect it’s because Miss Abbott is in no danger of permanent damage and
//Professor Quirrell thinks we’re learning valuable lessons,” Harry said in a
//hard voice. “Look, Miss Abbott, if you go, Tracey will also retire from the
//battle. You already outnumber us, so that’s a very good deal for your side.
//Please take it.”

// 13954
//“Hannah, just go!” said Daphne. “I mean, just say you’re out!”

// 13955
//When Daphne glanced back she saw that Hannah was shaking her head, still curled
//up in a ball on the grass.

// 13956
//“Oh, screw this,” said Harry. “__Chaotics! The faster we stun them, the
//faster she’s out of here! We’re going to do this very quickly, even if we take
//casualties! End truce! TUNAFISH!__”

// 13957
//Daphne’s political hindbrain had only an instant to admire how Harry’s few
//words had just made the Chaotics the __good__ guys, and then in almost
//perfect unison, the Chaotics were plunging their hands into the pockets of
//their uniforms and drawing out green sunglasses in an unfamiliar style. Not
//like anything you would wear to the beach, more like goggles for advanced
//Potions -

// 13958
//Then Daphne realized what was about to happen and snapped up her other hand to
//shield her eyes, just as Harry ripped the cloth off the cauldron.

// 13959
//The fluid that spilled forth as Harry Potter threw the cauldron’s contents into
//the air was too bright to be seen, too brilliant to be imagined, incandescent
//like the Sun magnified a dozen times -

// 13960
//(which was exactly what it was)

// 13961
//(the sunlight which had been invested to create the acorns, the bright energy
//that had fueled a tree rising up from the bare dirt)

// 13962
//(blazing a searing purple, the color of the mixed blue and red wavelengths that
//chlorophyll absorbed)

// 13963
//(with almost none of the green wavelengths that chlorophyll reflected to create
//the green color of leaves)

// 13964
//(which was the color of the Chaos Legion’s sunglasses, made to pass through
//green wavelengths, blocking red and blue, reducing even the most incandescent
//purple glare to something bearable)

// 13965
//- the violet light blazed on and on, Daphne tried dropping her arm from her
  //eyes but found that she couldn’t look directly at anything, even the
//secondhand purple glare was so bright she had to squint; and she had only time
//to cry one __Finite Incantatem,__ which didn’t work, before a Sleep Hex
//took her.

// 13967
//“NOW!” bellowed Blaise Zabini, formerly of Sunshine, now commanding a
//detachment of Chaos Legionnaires. “I mean, TUNAFISH!” The Slytherin boy’s hand
//grasped the cloth shielding the cauldron from the triggering touch of daylight,
//already beginning to move it aside.

// 13968
//“NOW!” bellowed Dean Thomas, formerly of Chaos, commanding a consignment of
//Dragon Warriors. “DO WHATEVER THEY DO!”

// 13969
//The Chaotics of Zabini’s detachment plunged their hands into their uniform
//pockets, and came forth bearing green sunglasses -

// 13970
//- an action almost perfectly mirrored by Dean and the Dragon Warriors, who drew
  //forth green-colored Potions goggles, and quickly drew the straps over their
//own heads, even as the Chaotics put on their sunglasses and the violet
//incandescence blasted forth.

// 13971
//(As General Malfoy had explained, if Mr. Goyle reported that the Chaos Legion
//was wearing green-colored Potions goggles, you didn’t have to know __why__

//“THAT’S CHEATING!” shrieked Blaise Zabini.

// 13973
//“THAT’S TECHNIQUE!” Dean yelled back. “DRAGONS, CHARGE!”

// 13974
//(“Pardon me,” the Lady Greengrass said. “Could you stop laughing like that, Mr.
//Quirrell? It’s unnerving.”)

// 13975
//“FINITE THEIR GOGGLES!” shouted Blaise Zabini, as the two armies ran headlong
//toward each other through omnipresent eye-searing purple glare. “WE CAN STILL
//WIN!”

// 13976
//“YOU HEARD HIM!” bellowed Dean. “GET THEIR GLASSES!”

// 13977
//Blaise Zabini’s reply to this wasn’t anything articulate.

***

// 13979
//“__Stupefy!__” shrieked the Sunshine General.

// 13980
//Draco didn’t dodge, he didn’t counter, he didn’t have enough energy left for
//either, all he could do was whip his left hand into position and hope -

// 13981
//The red stunbolt dissipated again on Draco’s __Colloportused__ glove,
//which he’d Transfigured and spell-locked to his hand the same as the rest of
//Dragon Army. It was all that was saving him now, that shield.

// 13982
//It should have been a time to counterattack, but Draco could only catch his
//breath, as the two of them danced backward and forward beneath the trees in the
//never-ending movements of their duel. Across from him, General Granger was
//panting hard, the young girl’s face glistening with sweat like dew, her
//chestnut hair wetted into brown plaits. Her camouflage uniform was stained with
//damp spots, her shoulders visibly trembling with exhaustion, but her wand was
//still steel-steady where it stayed level on Draco through all their motion. Her
//eyes glaring, her cheeks flushed with rage.

// 13983
//__So, little girl, why’re you pretending to fight like a grownup today?__

// 13984
//The taunt came to mind, but he didn’t really think he needed Granger any
//angrier; so instead Draco just said - though he could hear his own voice
//cracking - “Any reason you’re feeling mad at me, Granger?”

// 13985
//The girl was gasping for breath herself, her own voice wobbling as she spoke.
//“I know what you’re up to,” said Hermione Granger, her voice rising. “I know
//what you and Snape are up to, Malfoy, and I know who’s behind it!”

// 13986
//“Huh?” Draco said without even thinking about it.
//!72% 06.09

// 13987
//That only seemed to increase Granger’s fury, and her fingers whitened on the
//wand she held leveled on him.

// 13988
//And then Draco got it, and it boiled his own blood in his veins. Even
//__she__ thought he was secretly plotting against her -

// 13989
//“__You too?__” Draco yelled. ”__I helped you, you bucktoothed bint!
//You, you, you,” - __stuttering past all the Dark curses that came to mind until
//he found something he could actually cast at her - “__DENSAUGEO!__”

// 13990
//But Granger flashed and whirled around the Tooth-Lengthening Hex, and then her
//own wand came around and leveled at almost point-blank range, even as Draco
//brought up his left hand like a shield, placing the magic-locked glove between
//himself and whatever she was about to fire, and the Sunshine General’s own
//voice rose to a shriek audible across the whole battleground -

// 13991
//“__ALOHOMORA!__”

// 13992
//Time should have paused.

// 13993
//But it didn’t.

// 13994
//Instead the padlock clicked and fell off the glove.

// 13995
//Just like that.

// 13996
//Just like that.

// 13997
//The screens showed it all very clearly, to the entire watching Hogwarts
//stadium.

// 13998
//And the bone-dead-silent hush that fell over every bench in every bleacher said
//that everyone understood quite clearly what it meant, that the scion of House
//Malfoy had just had his magic overcome by a Muggleborn.

// 13999
//Hermione Granger didn’t pause in her fight, gave no sign that she even knew
//what she’d done; instead her foot snapped out in a Muggle-style kick that
//knocked Draco’s wand cleanly out of his hand, his shocked mind and body moving
//just a little too slowly. Draco dove after his wand, scrabbling frantically on
//the ground, but from behind him a girl’s cracking voice said
//“__Somnium!__” and Draco Malfoy fell and didn’t rise again.

// 14000
//There was another moment of frozen silence. The Sunshine General was wobbling
//on her feet, looking like she might faint.

// 14001
//Then the Dragon Warriors screamed at the top of their lungs and charged forward
//to avenge their fallen commander.

//Mr. and Mrs. Davis were shaking as they stood up from the comfortable chairs of

//Disillusioned themselves.

//The elderly Charles Nott said nothing as he stood from his chair. The scarred
//Lord Jugson said nothing, as he stood from his own chair.

// 14004
//Lucius Malfoy said nothing as he stood.

// 14005
//All three of them turned without pause and strode toward the stairwell of the
//elevated bleachers, moving in eerie unison like an Auror trio -

// 14006
//“Lord Malfoy,” the Defense Professor said in mild tones. That man was still
//seated in his own chair, looking upon his parchment-like screens, arms limp at
//his side, as though for some reason he didn’t feel like moving.
//!76% 07.09

// 14007
//The white-haired man halted just before reaching the exit archway, and the
//elderly man and the scarred man halted as well, flanking him. Lord Malfoy’s
//head turned, too slightly to be any form of acknowledgement, but in the Defense
//Professor’s direction.

// 14008
//“Your son performed exceptionally well today,” said Professor Quirrell. “I must
//confess that I underestimated him. And he has earned his army’s loyalty, as you
//have witnessed.” Still very mild, the Defense Professor’s voice. “Speaking as
//your son’s teacher, it is my opinion that he will not benefit if you interfere
//in his -”

// 14009
//Lord Malfoy and his compatriots vanished down the stairs.

// 14010
//“A fine try, Quirinus,” Dumbledore said quietly. The old wizard’s face showed
//small lines of worry; he hadn’t risen from his own seat either, staring at the
//parchment screens as though they were still active. “Do you think he will
//listen?”

// 14011
//The Defense Professor’s shoulders twitched in a slight shrug, the only movement
//they’d shown since the battle ended.

// 14012
//“__Well__,” said the Lady Greengrass, as she rose up and cracked her
//knuckles, stretching, her husband silent beside her. “I must say, that was
//quite… interesting…”

// 14013
//Amelia Bones had risen from her own cushioned seat without any fuss.
//“Interesting indeed,” said Director Bones. “I do confess, I find myself
//disturbed by the skill with which those children were fighting one another.”

// 14014
//“The skill?” Lord Greengrass said. “Their spells didn’t seem all that
//impressive to me. Except for Daphne’s, of course.”

// 14015
//The old witch did not move her eyes from where she was gazing at the Defense
//Professor’s balding head. “The Stunning Hex is not a first-year spell, Lord
//Greengrass, but that is not the skill I had in mind. They supported each other
//with those simple spells, they reacted at speed to surprises…” The Director of
//the DMLE paused, as though searching for words that a mere civilian could
//understand. “In the midst of battle,” she said finally, “with spells flying in
//every direction… those children seemed quite at home.”

// 14016
//“Indeed, Director Bones,” said the Defense Professor. “Some arts are best begun
//in youth.”

// 14017
//The old witch’s eyes narrowed. “You are readying them to become a military
//force, Professor. To what end?”

// 14018
//“Now hold on!” interjected Lord Greengrass. “There’s plenty of schools where
//they teach dueling in first year!”

// 14019
//“Dueling?” said the Defense Professor. From behind it wasn’t visible if the
//pale face was smiling. “That is nothing, Lord Greengrass, to what my students
//have learned. They have learned not to hesitate in the face of ambushes and
//greater foes. They have learned to adapt when combat conditions change and
//change again. They have learned to protect their allies, to protect more those
//who are more valuable, to abandon pieces which cannot be rescued. They have
//learned that to survive they must follow orders. Some have even learned a
//little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass, __these__ wizards will not
//hide in their manors and wait to be protected, when the next threat comes. They
//will know that they know how to fight.”

// 14020
//Augusta Longbottom loudly clapped her hands together three times.

//__We won.__

// 14022
//It was the first thing Draco heard when he woke up on the battlefield, Padma
//telling him how his soldiers had rallied after he fell. How, thanks to the
//Dragon General’s foresight, Mr. Thomas had led his detachment to victory over
//Chaos. How General Potter had defeated the portion of the Sunshine Regiment
//that clashed with him. How Mr. Thomas’s Dragon Warriors had rejoined the main
//body of soldiers bearing both their own goggles and the sunglasses of the
//defeated Chaotics. How, only moments later, General Potter’s remaining
//contingent had attacked both other armies with a potion that emitted searing
//purple light. But Dragon had held the numerical advantage over Sunshine and
//Chaos both, and enough sunglasses for their warriors; and so Padma had managed
//to lead her inherited army to victory.
//!80% 08.09

// 14023
//From the light in Padma’s eyes and her arrogant smile that would have done
//proud to a Malfoy, she was expecting congratulations. Draco managed to grit out
//some form of praise from between his clenched teeth, and couldn’t have said
//afterward what it was. The foreign-born witch, it appeared, hadn’t any idea
//what’d happened, or what it meant.

// 14024
//__I lost.__

// 14025
//The Dragons trudged back to Hogwarts beneath gray skies, cold droplets landing
//heavy on Draco’s skin, one by one. While he’d been stunned, it had begun, the
//long-promised rain finally beginning to fall. There was only one option left to
//Draco now. A forced move, as Mr. MacNair, who’d taught Draco chess, would have
//termed it. Harry Potter probably wouldn’t like it, if he really was in love
//with Granger the way everyone said. But the forced move, as Mr. MacNair had
//defined it, was one you needed to make if you wanted the game to continue at
//all.

// 14026
//It kept on playing in Draco’s mind, over and over again, even as he walked like
//an automaton through the massive portals of Hogwarts, sent away Vincent and
//Gregory with two sharp words, and became alone within his private bedroom,
//sitting on his bed, staring at the wall above his desk. Filling his mind like a
//Dementor had locked him into the memory.

// 14027
//The padlock on his glove clicking and falling away -

// 14028
//Draco knew, he __knew__ what he’d done wrong. He’d been so tired after
//casting twenty-seven Locking Charms for all the other Dragon Warriors. Less
//than a minute wasn’t enough time to recover after each spell. And so he’d
//__just__ cast __Colloportus__ on his own padlocked glove,
//__just__ cast the spell, not put in all his strength to bind it stronger
//than Harry Potter or Hermione Granger could undo.

// 14029
//But nobody was going to believe that, even if it was true. Even in Slytherin,
//nobody would believe that. It sounded like an excuse, and an excuse was all
//that anyone would hear.

// 14030
//__Granger whirled and spun and screamed ‘ALOHOMORA!’__ -

// 14031
//Draco’s mind kept playing it over and over as the resentment built. He’d helped
//Granger - cooperated with her on banning traitors - held her hand as she’d
//dangled off the roof - stopped a riot from breaking out around her in the Great
//Hall - did she have any idea what he’d risked, what he’d probably already
//__lost__, what it meant for the heir of House Malfoy to do that for a
//__mudblood__ -

// 14032
//And now there was only one move left, and the thing about a forced move was
//that you __had__ to make it, even if it meant getting detention and losing
//House points. Professor Snape would know and understand, but there were limits
//(Father had warned him) to what the Potions Master would overlook.

// 14033
//Challenge Granger to a wizard’s duel, in open defiance of Hogwarts regulations.
//Attack her outright, if she tried to refuse. Defeat her one-on-one, in public,
//not with clever dueling technique, but by __overpowering__ her magic. Beat
//her solidly, completely, crush her as utterly as the Dark Lord himself had
//crushed his enemies. Make it absolutely clear to everyone, so that nobody could
//possibly doubt, that Draco had just been exhausted from casting the spell so
//many times. Prove that the Malfoy blood was stronger than any mudblood’s -

// 14034
//__Only it’s not,__ Harry Potter’s voice whispered inside Draco’s mind.
//__It’s easy to forget what’s really true, Draco, once you start trying to
//win at politics. But in reality there’s only one thing that makes you a wizard,
//remember?__

// 14035
//Draco knew, then, he knew the reason for the disquiet in the back of his mind,
//as he stared at the blank wall above his desk contemplating his forced move. It
//should’ve been simple - when you only had one move, the thing to do was make it
//- but -

// 14036
//__Granger whirling, spinning, sweat-dampened hair flying around her,
//bolts flying from her wand as fast as his own, jinx and counter-jinx, glowing
//bats flying at his face, and through all of it the look of fury in Granger’s
//eyes -__
//!84% 09.09

// 14037
//There’d been a part of him admiring that, before it had all gone wrong,
//admiring Granger’s fury and power; a part of him that had exulted in the first
//real fight he’d ever been in, against…

// 14038
//…an equal opponent.

// 14039
//If he challenged Granger, and __lost…__

// 14040
//It ought not to be possible, Draco had gotten his wand two full years before
//anyone else in his Hogwarts class.

// 14041
//Only there was a reason why they usually didn’t bother giving wands to
//nine-year-olds. Age counted too, it wasn’t just how long you’d held a wand.
//Granger’s birthday had been only a few days into the year, when Harry had
//bought her that pouch. That meant she was twelve now, that she’d been twelve
//almost since the start of Hogwarts. And the truth was, Draco hadn’t been
//practicing much outside of class, probably not nearly as much as Hermione
//Granger of Ravenclaw. Draco hadn’t thought he needed any more practice to stay
//ahead…

// 14042
//__And Granger was exhausted too,__ whispered the Voice of Contrary
//Evidence inside him. Granger must have been exhausted from all those Stunning
//Hexes, and even in that state she’d been able to undo his Locking Charm.

// 14043
//And Draco __could not__ afford to challenge Granger publicly, one-on-one
//with no excuses, and lose.

// 14044
//Draco knew what you were supposed to do in this sort of situation. You were
//supposed to cheat. But if anyone discovered Draco cheating, it would be
//disastrous, perfect blackmail material even if it never got out publicly, and
//any Slytherins watching would __know__ that, they’d be __looking__…

//And then, if you were watching, you would have seen Draco Malfoy get up from
//his bed, and go to his desk, and take out a sheet of the finest sheepskin
//parchment, and a pearl-carven inkwell, filled with greenish-silver ink that had
//been made with true silver and crushed emeralds. From the great trunk at his
//bed’s foot, the Slytherin drew forth a book bound also in silver and emeralds,
//entitled __The Etiquette of the Houses of Britain.__ And with a new, clean
//quill, Draco Malfoy began to write, frequently looking to the book where it lay
//open as a reference. There was a grim smile on the boy’s face, making the young
//Malfoy look very much like his father, as he carefully drew each letter as
//though it were a separate artwork.

//Draco paused, carefully moving the quill aside so that it wouldn’t drip. He
//needed a pretext for this, at least if he wanted to impose the duel’s
//conditions. The challenged had the choice of terms __unless __they had

// 14051
//What was he thinking? Granger __had__ insulted him.

//Draco flipped the book to the page of standard formulae, and found one that
//seemed appropriate.

//__I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress, for that I have thrice
//over helped you and offered you only my goodwill, and in return you falsely
//accused me of plotting against you,__

// 14054
//Draco had to stop and take a breath, forcing down the seething anger; he was
//starting to genuinely feel the insult now, and he’d just written out the last
//phrase and underlined it without thinking, like it was an ordinary letter.
//After a moment’s reflection, he decided to let it stand; it might not be the
//exact formal phrasing but it had a raw, angry tone that seemed appropriate.

//__Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law, by__

// 14057
//“The seventeenth ruling of the thirty-first Wizengamot,” Draco said aloud
//without looking, a line delivered in many plays; he sat straighter as he said
//it, feeling every pulse of the noble blood in his veins.

//__Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law, by the 17th

//If the duel went poorly, Draco could just say nothing and leave it at that. And

//Draco signed the formal parchment, and then drew forth his ordinary and lesser
//parchment, and his regular ink, for his post scriptum:

// 14067
//__If you don’t know how the rules work, Granger, here’s how it is. You
//insulted a Most Ancient House, and I’ve got the lawful right to challenge. And

//the trophy room, or even just telling anyone else, my father will take you and
//your false honor straight to the Wizengamot.__

// 14068
//__Draco Malfo__

//On the last letter his quill pressed down on the parchment so viciously that
//the nib snapped off, creating a streak of ink and a small rip in the parchment,

//That night at dinnertime, Susan Bones came to Harry Potter and told him that
//she thought Draco Malfoy was going to carry out his plot against Hermione very
//soon. She was warning all the members of S.P.H.E.W., and she’d warned Professor
//Sprout, and she’d warned Professor Flitwick, and she was going to send a letter
//to her Aunt tonight, and now she was warning Harry Potter, too. Only they
//couldn’t quite talk about it with Padma - Susan said, looking very serious -
//because Padma was feeling torn between her loyalty to Hermione and her loyalty
//to her General.

// 14071
//Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, who was at this point feeling more frustrated
//with the entire situation than anything really __productive__, snapped at
//her that __yes__, he knew something had to be done.

// 14072
//After Susan Bones left, Harry looked over at the other end of the Ravenclaw
//table, where Hermione had sat down away from him or Padma or Anthony or any of
//her other friends.

// 14073
//But Hermione didn’t look like she was in a mood where somebody going over and
//bothering her would be taken very well.

//Later, looking backward, Harry would think of how, in his SF and fantasy
//novels, people always made their big, important choices for big, important
//reasons. Hari Seldon had created his Foundation to rebuild the ashes of the
//Galactic Empire, not because he would look more important if he could be in
//charge of his own research group. Raistlin Majere had severed ties with his
//brother because he wanted to become a god, not because he was incompetent at
//personal relationships and unwilling to ask for advice on how to do better.
//Frodo Baggins had taken the Ring because he was a hero who wanted to save
//Middle-Earth, not because it would’ve been too awkward not to. If anyone ever
//wrote a true history of the world - not that anyone ever could or would -
//probably 97// of all the key moments of Fate would turn out to be constructed of
//lies and tissue paper and trivial little thoughts that somebody could’ve just
//as easily thought differently.

//Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres looked at Hermione Granger, where she’d sat
//down at the other end of the table, and felt a sense of reluctance to bother
//her when she looked like she was already in a bad mood.

// 14076
//So then Harry thought that it probably made more sense to talk to Draco Malfoy
//first, just so that he could absolutely positively definitely assure Hermione
//that Draco really wasn’t plotting against her.

// 14077
//And later on after dinner, when Harry went down to the Slytherin basement and
//was told by Vincent that __the boss ain’t to be disturbed__… then Harry
//thought that maybe he should see if Hermione would talk to him right away. That
//he should just get started on unraveling the whole mess before it raveled any
//further. Harry wondered if he might just be procrastinating, if his mind had
//just found a clever excuse to put off something unenjoyable-but-necessary.

// 14078
//He actually thought that.

// 14079
//And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he’d just talk to Draco
//Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday breakfast, and __then__ talk
//to Hermione.

//Human beings did that sort of thing all the time.

//It was Sunday morning, on the 5th of April, 1992, and the simulated sky above
//the Great Hall of Hogwarts showed great torrents of rain pouring down in such
//density that the lightning flashes were diminished and scattered into small
//pulses of white light that sometimes transformed the House tables, paling their
//faces and making all the students appear briefly to be ghosts.

// 14082
//Harry sat at the Ravenclaw table, wearily eating a waffle, waiting for Draco to
//make an appearance so that he could get started on sorting this whole thing
//out. There was a __Quibbler__ being passed around which had somehow ended
//up with Hannah and Daphne on the front page, but it hadn’t gotten to his place
//yet.

// 14083
//A few minutes later Harry finished eating his waffle, and then looked around
//again to see if Draco had arrived yet for breakfast at the Slytherin table.

// 14084
//It was odd.

// 14085
//Draco Malfoy was almost never late.

// 14086
//Since Harry was looking in the direction of the Slytherin table, he didn’t see
//Hermione Granger entering through the huge doors of the Great Hall. Thus he was
//rather startled when he turned back and discovered Hermione sitting down
//directly beside him at the Ravenclaw table, just as if she hadn’t not-done that
//for more than a week.

// 14087
//“Hi, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice sounding almost exactly normal. She
//started to put toast on her plate and a selection of healthy fruits and
//vegetables. “How are you?”

// 14088
//“Within one standard deviation of my own peculiar little average,” Harry
//automatically replied. “How are you doing? Did you sleep okay?”

// 14089
//There were dark bags under Hermione Granger’s eyes.

// 14090
//“Why, yes, I’m fine,” said Hermione Granger.

// 14091
//“Um,” Harry said. He took a slice of pie onto his plate (as his brain was
//occupied with other things, Harry’s hand simply took the tastiest thing within
//range, without evaluating complex concepts like whether he was ready to eat
//dessert). “Um, Hermione, I’m going to need to talk to you later today, is that
//okay?”

// 14092
//“Sure,” said Hermione. “Why wouldn’t it be?”

// 14093
//“Because -” Harry said. “I mean - you and I haven’t - for the last few days -”

// 14094
//__Shut up,__ suggested an internal part of Harry that seemed to have been
//recently allocated for governing Hermione-related issues.

// 14095
//Hermione Granger didn’t look like she was paying much attention to him in any
//case. She just stared down at her plate, and then, after about ten seconds of
//awkward silence, began to eat her tomato slices, one after another, without
//pause.

// 14096
//Harry looked away from her and began to eat a slice of pie which, he
//discovered, had somehow materialized on his plate.

// 14097
//“So!” Hermione Granger suddenly said after she’d polished off most of her plate
//in silence. “Anything happening today?”

// 14098
//“Um…” Harry said. He looked around frantically, as though to find
//something-happening that he could use as conversational fodder.

// 14099
//And so Harry was one of the first to see it, and wordlessly point, although the
//sudden swell of whispers that swept through the Great Hall showed that a number
//of other people had seen it too.

// 14100
//The distinctive crimson tinge of the robes would have been recognizable
//anywhere, but it still took Harry’s brain a few moments to place the faces. An
//Asianish-looking man, solemn, and today looking rather grim. A man with a
//piercing gaze that swept over the room, his long black hair waving behind him
//in a ponytail. A man thin and pale and unshaven, with a face so blank that it
//was like stone. It took Harry a few moment to place the faces, and remember the
//names, from that long-ago day in January when the Dementor had come to
//Hogwarts: __Komodo, Butnaru, Goryanof.__

// 14101
//“An Auror trio?” Hermione said in a strange bright voice. “Why, I wonder what
//they’d be doing here.”

// 14102
//Dumbledore was in their company as well, looking as worried as Harry had ever
//seen him; and after a moment’s pause while the old wizard’s eyes scanned the
//Great Hall and the students whispering over their breakfasts, he pointed -

// 14103
//- straight at Harry.

// 14104
//“Oh, now what,” Harry said under his breath. His inward thoughts were a lot
//more panicked than that, as he wondered frantically if anyone had connected him
//to the Azkaban breakout somehow. He looked at the Head Table, trying to make
//the glance casual, and realized that Professor Quirrell was nowhere to be seen,
//this morning -

// 14105
//The Aurors swept toward him with swift strides, Auror Goryanof approaching from
//the other side of the Ravenclaw table as though to block any escape in that
//direction, Auror Komodo and Auror Butnaru approaching from Harry’s side, the
//Headmaster following straight on Komodo’s heels.

// 14106
//All conversation everywhere had ground to utter silence.

// 14107
//The Aurors reached Harry’s place at the table, surrounding him from three
//angles.

// 14108
//“Yes?” Harry said, as normally as he could. “What is it?”

// 14109
//“Hermione Granger,” Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice, “you are under
//arrest for the attempted murder of Draco Malfoy.”
